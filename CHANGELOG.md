## [2.1.0] - 2016-06-21

### Added
- TLS implementation. So far it is an experimental feature.
- Insert using command syntax with mongo server >= 2.6
- UpdateMany and UpdateAll commands. They use bulk operations from mongo

  >= 2.6. If mongo server version is below 2.6 then it sends many individual
  deletes.

### Changed

No more closed handles because of bad arguments.
