Like any "latent cursor", the cursor may become invalid at some point â€“ for example if the final object it references were deleted. Thus, you should be prepared to requery on CursorNotFound exception.
    | SlaveOK  -- ^ Allow query of replica slave. Normally these return an error except for namespace "local".
    | NoCursorTimeout  -- ^ The server normally times out idle cursors after 10 minutes to prevent a memory leak in case a client forgets to close a cursor. Set this option to allow a cursor to live forever until it is closed.

--  | Exhaust  -- ^ Stream the data down full blast in multiple "more" packages, on the assumption that the client will fully read all data queried. Faster when you are pulling a lot of data and know you want to pull it all down. Note: the client is not allowed to not read all the data unless it closes the connection.
-- Exhaust commented out because not compatible with current `Pipeline` implementation
