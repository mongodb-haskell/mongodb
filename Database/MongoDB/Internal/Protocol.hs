Like any "latent cursor", the cursor may become invalid at some point – for example if the final object it references were deleted. Thus, you should be prepared to requery on @CursorNotFound@ exception.

--  | Exhaust  -- ^ Stream the data down full blast in multiple "more" packages, on the assumption that the client will fully read all data queried. Faster when you are pulling a lot of data and know you want to pull it all down. Note: the client is not allowed to not read all the data unless it closes the connection.
